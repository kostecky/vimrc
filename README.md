vimrc
=====

This .vimrc is a good basic set of utilities to get your vim editor
in to a state that is very useful for developing puppet manifests
and modules. It maintains a set of defaults that I find useful as well.

OS X Installation
=====
1. You first need to install brew

   ```
   ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
   ```
  
2. Get your PATH set up right and place the following in your ~/.profile. 
  
   ```
   export PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:~/bin:$PATH:
   ```
  
   **Once you do this, close all your shells/terminals and reopen**
  
3. You then *need* to install macvim to get the YouCompleteMe plugin 
   working. Don't worry, if you symlink the binary to vim/vi it won't load a gui

   ```
   brew install macvim
   ```
  
4. Link vim to the macvim binary

   ```
   cd /usr/local/bin
   ln -s mvim vim
   ln -s mvim vi
   ```
  **Once you do this, close all your shells/terminals and reopen**

5. Get Vundle all set up

   ```
   mkdir ~/.vim/bundle
   git clone https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
   ```
   
6. Create your ~/.vimrc file using the .vimrc from this repo or 
   if you're a pro, you can manually cobble it together.

   ```
   vim ~/.vimrc
   ```

7. Exit vim, reload it, and run :BundleInstall

   ```
   <in vim> :q
   vim ~/.vimrc
   <in vim> :BundleInstall
  ```

8. Once it's done its BundleInstall, exit vim, and compile YouCompleteMe.
   You will see an error message generated by YouCompleteMe before you compile
   the requisite portion.

   ```
   cd ~/.vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe/
   ./install.sh --clang-completer
   ```

9. Install the appropriate linters for python, puppet, ruby, yaml

   ```
   pip install flake8
   gem install puppet-lint
   gem install ruby-lint
   npm install -g js-yaml
   ```

10. You're ready to work with puppet!
